Agile model - E-Commerce website(ARYA)

Here is a general overview of the Agile process for developing an e-commerce website:

1. Define the project vision and high-level requirements: The development team works with the customer to define the overall goals and objectives of the project, as well as the key features and functionality that the website will need to have.

2. Break the project into small, manageable chunks: The development team breaks the project down into smaller pieces, called "user stories," which represent specific features or functionality that the website will need to have.

3. Prioritize the user stories: The development team works with the customer to prioritize the user stories based on their importance and value to the business.

4. Develop and deliver the user stories in short sprints: The development team works through the user stories one at a time, delivering completed features to the customer at the end of each sprint.

5. Get feedback and adjust the plan: After each sprint, the development team reviews the progress made and solicits feedback from the customer. Based on this feedback, the team adjusts the plan for the next sprint to ensure that the project stays on track and meets the customer's needs.


High level requirements:

A user-friendly interface: The website should be easy to navigate and use, with clear and intuitive menus, buttons, and links.

Product catalog: The website should have a comprehensive catalog of products, including descriptions, images, and pricing information.

Search and filtering capabilities: Customers should be able to easily search for and filter products based on various criteria, such as price, color, size, and more.

Shopping cart: Customers should be able to add items to their shopping cart and view the contents of their cart at any time.

Checkout process: The website should have a smooth and secure checkout process, including options for different payment methods.

Order tracking: Customers should be able to track the status of their orders, including delivery status and any issues that may arise.

Customer account management: Customers should be able to create and manage their own accounts, including viewing past orders and saving payment and shipping information.

Mobile responsiveness: The website should be optimized for use on mobile devices, with a responsive design that adjusts to different screen sizes and resolutions.

Security: The website should have appropriate security measures in place to protect customer data and prevent fraud.

Scalability: The website should be able to handle a large volume of traffic and transactions without performance issues.

Integration with other systems: The website may need to integrate with other systems, such as inventory management systems or shipping carriers.

Marketing and analytics: The website should have features for marketing and analyzing customer behavior, such as email marketing campaigns and Google Analytics integration.
